I require information about the number of iron infusions administered (iron polymaltose and iron carboxymaltose) during period 01/02/2022 to 31/07/2022. The pharmacy have been able to give me data on the number administered on FCCU and S2F/CCU however I need more specifically the number administered for patients under cardiology and heart failure services on these wards (excluding patients that were under other units such as gen med, renal etc.).
